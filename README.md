CodeBrew Coffee – Modern Café Website UI

CodeBrew Coffee is a modern, responsive café website designed with a warm “dark roast” aesthetic. The project focuses on creating a visually engaging user interface while maintaining clear navigation and readability.

The design uses a deep chocolate background combined with cream content sections and golden-orange accents to highlight important actions. This color balance creates a cozy coffee-shop atmosphere while keeping the layout professional and easy to explore.

The website includes several key sections such as a hero landing area with strong call-to-action buttons, an about section telling the café story, a menu showcasing drinks and food, a gallery displaying the café experience, and a contact section with a functional form and business information.

The layout follows modern UI principles including responsive grids, consistent spacing, rounded components, and clear visual hierarchy. The goal of this project was to practice clean UI design and build a structured multi-section website that reflects a real café brand.
